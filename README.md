My solutions to [AoC 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in Dyalog APL, a bizarre language in which I am a total beginner.
So don't expect the solutions to be elegant, performant, original, or readable.

All solutions assume Dyalog 18.2 defaults (`⎕IO ← 0`, `⎕ML ← 1`, etc.) except where they are explicitly modified.
